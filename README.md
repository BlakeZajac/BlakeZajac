# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Blake Zajac!
I'm a Sydney-based UX designer with a passion for creating exceptional user experiences. My design philosophy centres around simplicity, elegance, and functionality, and I specialise in Figma and WordPress to bring my ideas to life. I'm constantly learning and growing, and I'm currently working on expanding my skills in React.

# ðŸ‘€ Interests
In addition to my work as a UX designer, I have a wide range of interests that keep me inspired and engaged. Some of my favorites include:

- ðŸŽ¨ Photography and fashion: I love exploring visual aesthetics and using my camera to capture the beauty of the world around me.
- ðŸŽ® Gaming: Whether I'm playing on my PC or my phone, I love immersing myself in new worlds and challenging my skills.
- ðŸŽµ I find inspiration in everything from classical to hip-hop and love discovering new artists and genres.

# ðŸ’» What I'm working on
Right now, I'm actively seeking new opportunities to collaborate on exciting front-end development and UX design projects. If you have a project you'd like to work on together, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
